The ctypes module provides C compatible data types and functions to load DLLs so that calls can be made to C shared libraries without having to modify them. The fact that the C side needn\u2019t be touched adds to the simplicity of this method. Example Simple C code to add two numbers, save it as add.c //sample C file to add 2 numbers - int and floats int add_int(int, int); float add_float(float, float); int add_int(int num1, int num2){ return num1 + num2; } float add_float(float num1, float num2){ return num1 + num2; }","title":"archive"},{"location":"2020/Python_CTypes/#ctypes","text":"The Python ctypes module is probably the easiest way to call C functions from Python.

According to Wikipedia, an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. However, an iterator performs traversal and gives access to data elements in a container, but does not perform iteration. You might be confused so lets take it a bit slow. There are three parts namely: Iterable Iterator Iteration All of these parts are linked to each other. We will discuss them one by one and later talk about generators. 3.1. Iterable An iterable is any object in Python which has an __iter__ or a __getitem__ method defined which returns an iterator or can take indexes (You can read more about them here). In short an iterable is any object which can provide us with an iterator. So what is an iterator? rm Click to expand! ## Heading 1.
